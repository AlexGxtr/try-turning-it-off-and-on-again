Incident Description
On [03.01.2023], the user attempted to update their Windows 10 system from Build 1909 to the latest version, Build 22H2, using the Windows 10 Assistant Tool.

This unexpected issue resulted in the inability to complete the update to the new Windows version.

Analysis and Solution
[Investigation]:
The user first investigated the error message to understand the cause of the failed update. The "Undoing changes" message typically indicates that the system encountered an error during the update process and automatically reverted the changes to the previous state.

[Windows 10 Assistant Tool Check]:
To ensure that the Windows 10 Assistant Tool was not corrupted or causing the issue, the user re-downloaded the tool from the official Microsoft website and attempted the update process again. Unfortunately, the same error occurred during the reboot phase.

[Repair Upgrade Approach]:
Considering the need to preserve existing software and settings, the user opted for a Repair Upgrade. This involved performing an upgrade installation using the Windows 10 ISO file for the same build version (1909) rather than a full reinstallation.

[Repair Upgrade Procedure]:
The user used the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool to create a bootable USB drive with the Windows 10 ISO file for Build 1909. They then initiated the Repair Upgrade process, selecting the option to keep files and settings during the upgrade.

[Repair Upgrade Completion]:
After the Repair Upgrade was completed successfully, the system was now running Windows 10, Build 1909. All previously installed software and settings remained intact.

Results
By opting for a Repair Upgrade using the Windows 10 ISO file for the same build version (1909), the user effectively resolved the issue that occurred during the update to Build 22H2. The system remained stable, and the user could continue using the existing software and settings without the need for a full OS reinstallation.
